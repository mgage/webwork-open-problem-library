The following few problems ask you to solve exponential equations of
increasing complexity.  Your answer needs to be a decimal number with
at least four digits. The first problem is easy:

$BR

The solution of the equation
\[5^x=100\]
is
\(x=\)
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(log(100)/log(5), mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
\[x=\log_5 100 = \frac{\ln 100}{\ln 5} \approx 2.861.\]

EOT
